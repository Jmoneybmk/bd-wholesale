# Wholesale NPC

## Description
This script brings various NPCs throughout the map that players, depending on the job they have are able to sell to the npcs.
As well as giving player the option to buy from other types of npcs as long as they have the required item, if any. Whatever
a player sells to the Seller's NPC, it will then get distributed into the inventory system of the other NPCs where players 
buy from as long as that NPC sells that item. The NPC will also showcase the quantity available for each item. This allows
players to feel more involved in the servers economic development.
